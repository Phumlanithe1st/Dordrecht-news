        The Greyling family welcomes you to the 100th birthday celebration of Universal Garage. 
        We look forward to celebrating this milestone with all of our treasured clients, staff, friends and family. 
        The Dordrecht community has built this business to be what it is, and we appreciate the support and loyalty 
        that you â€“ and the generations before â€“ have shown towards Universal Garage.

        It has been an honour to be at your service for the past century, and we look forward to the years to come. 
        We have been blessed in abundance â€“ to God be the glory! We trust you will enjoy this weekend of celebrations with us.
